## Goal

The objective of this task is to develop a Python-based solution (packaged as an executable) that automates the verification and remediation of net accounts settings in alignment with the CIS Windows 10 Benchmark. This will reduce reliance on manual UI-based corrections suggested by the Wazuh SCA module, thereby saving time and effort while ensuring consistent compliance.

## Setup Instructions 
### 1. Development of Python Code and Executable file
[Python Code](cis_win10_benchmark_net_accounts_remediations.py) is developed and [.exe file](cis_win10_benchmark_net_accounts_remediations.exe) is created using pyinstaller.

### 2. Execute the .exe on a fresh, unconfigured Windows 10 system
### Before execution 'net accounts' result
